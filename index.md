## My Second Header
Hello, this is my markdown file!
![My sample image](https://octodex.github.com/images/yaktocat.png)
```javascript
var myVar = "Hello, world!";
console.log(myVar);

- The **first line with `javascript`** tells GitHub to highlight it as JavaScript.  
- You can replace it with **`python`**, **`html`**, or just leave it blank for plain code.  
- Make sure you use **three backticks** at the start and end.
- [ ] Turn on GitHub Pages  
- [ ] Outline my portfolio
